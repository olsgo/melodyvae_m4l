# Grid Offset Feature

## Overview
The Grid Offset control allows you to scale the timing variations (humanization) in generated melodies. This addresses the issue of generated patterns sounding "very quantized" by providing user control over timing offset intensity.

## How It Works
The Grid Offset parameter multiplies the timing offset values generated by the VAE model:

- **0.0**: Completely quantized output (no timing variation)
- **0.5**: Subtle timing variations (half the original offset)
- **1.0**: Full timing variations (original VAE output) - Default
- **1.5-2.0**: Exaggerated timing variations (amplified swing/groove)

## Usage
1. Train a model with MIDI data (timing offsets are automatically learned)
2. Generate patterns as usual
3. Adjust the "grid offset" dial (located below the duration control)
4. Re-generate to hear the difference in timing quantization

## Technical Details
- Timing offsets are extracted during MIDI processing using `getNoteIndexAndTimeshift()`
- The VAE learns these offsets as a 4th output (alongside onsets, velocities, durations)
- During generation, timeshift values are scaled by the grid_offset parameter
- Scaled values are passed to the `makenote_for_me` subpatch which applies the timing

## Benefits
- **Musical Expression**: Create more human-like, less robotic patterns
- **Style Control**: Adjust timing intensity for different musical genres
- **Creative Flexibility**: From perfectly quantized to heavily swung rhythms
- **Real-time Control**: Immediate feedback when adjusting the parameter

This feature is inspired by RhythmVAE_M4L and provides the same level of timing control for melodic patterns.
