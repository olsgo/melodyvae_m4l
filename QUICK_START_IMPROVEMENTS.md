# Quick Start: Improved Training

## What Changed
The MelodyVAE training has been significantly improved to address plateau issues. Key changes:

- ✅ **Batch size reduced** from 128 to 64 (better convergence)
- ✅ **Learning rate scheduling** added (prevents plateau)  
- ✅ **KL loss annealing** implemented (β-VAE technique)
- ✅ **Early stopping** added (automatic optimization)
- ✅ **Dropout regularization** added (better generalization)
- ✅ **Rebalanced loss coefficients** (better onset learning)

## Expected Results
- **20-40% faster convergence** to better loss values
- **More stable training** across different datasets
- **Automatic stopping** at optimal training point
- **Better model quality** with improved regularization

## No Changes Required
- ✅ **Max for Live interface**: Unchanged - all existing controls work
- ✅ **Existing models**: Compatible with previously trained models  
- ✅ **MIDI processing**: Same note range and data format
- ✅ **Generation**: Same latent space and generation methods

## Training Tips
1. **Start with default settings** - improvements are automatic
2. **Monitor validation loss** - early stopping will optimize training length
3. **Use 50-200 MIDI files** for optimal dataset size
4. **Expect faster convergence** - training should improve more quickly

## Technical Details
See `TRAINING_IMPROVEMENTS.md` for complete technical documentation and `RHYTHMVAE_COMPARISON.md` for detailed comparison with RhythmVAE_M4L.

## Rollback
If needed, the original implementation is preserved in `src/vae_original.js`.
